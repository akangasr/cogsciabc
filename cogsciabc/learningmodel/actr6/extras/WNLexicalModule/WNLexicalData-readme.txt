ACT-R/WN-LEXICAL :: WNLexicalData

The folder "WNLexicalData" contains the files that are used by the ACT-R
WN-Lexical module. The whole folder and its content must be copied to the
"actr6/" folder. 

The files, "WNChunks.data" and "WNChunksIndexes.data" were generated from the
Prolog version of WordNet 3.0 ( http://wordnet.princeton.edu/obtain ).

The WNLexical data files can be obtained from http://sourceforge.net/projects/actr-wn-lexical/

In addition, the most recent package "WNLexicalModule" must be downloaded and installed by following the instructions in the "WNLexicalModule" package.

Before loading act-r 6, you should have the following files present. 

actr6/WNLexicalData/WNChunks.data
actr6/WNLexicalData/WNChunksIndexes.data
actr6/modules/WNLexical_(version number).lisp
